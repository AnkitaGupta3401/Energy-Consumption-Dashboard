Energy Consumption Dashboard using Power BI

📌 Overview
This project is an "Energy Consumption Dashboard" built using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize energy usage patterns. The dashboard provides insightful analytics, helping users monitor and optimize energy consumption effectively.

🎯 Features
- 📊 Interactive Visualizations – Dynamic charts and graphs representing energy consumption trends.
- 🔍 Real-Time Data Analysis – Analyze energy usage over time and across different parameters.
- 📈 Performance Metrics – Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as peak consumption hours, cost analysis, and energy efficiency.
- ⚡ Custom Filters & Slicers – Allow users to drill down and filter data for specific time periods, locations, or departments.
- 🏠 Sustainability Insights – Identify areas for potential energy savings and optimization.

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Power BI – Data visualization and dashboard creation
- Excel / CSV / SQL – Data sources for analysis
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for data modeling and calculations
